# Analyze a non-accessible web site

## Instructions

Identify a web site that you believe is NOT accessible, and create an action plan to improve its accessibility. Your first task would be to identify this site, detail the ways that you think it is inaccessible without using analytic tools, and then put it through a Lighthouse analysis. Take the results of this analysis and outline a detailed plan with a minimum of ten points showing how the site could be improved.

This site doesn't have a descriptive heading hierarchy, in fact it doesn't have a semantic structure because uses to much divs instead other semantic tags as section or main. So we can't find or reading some important information includes on it with screenreader as telephone numbers.



1 Improve the usage of ARIA in your application which may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
2 Try to use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance.
3 Improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
4 Improve Links because links to cross-origin destinations are unsafe. 
5 Links do not have descriptive text. Descriptive link text helps search engines understand your content. 
6 Set a theme color for the address bar.
7 Improve tags and don’t repeat “id” in different elements. 
8 Improve image elements because do not have explicit width and height and also don’t have “alt” description. 
9 Add a hrefflang, they should list in search results for a given language or region. 
10 The document does not use <meta http-equiv="refresh"> Users do not expect a page to refresh automatically, and doing so will move focus back to the top of the page. This may create a frustrating or confusing experience.
