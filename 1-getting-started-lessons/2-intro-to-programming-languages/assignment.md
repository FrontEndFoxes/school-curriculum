# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

1. Transformation tools such as Frameworks (Angular, React, Vue) should be used by a web developer because they are useful to build web applications and allows the rapid creation of UI features. Angular, React, and Vue can all be used to develop Progressive Web Apps, also known as PWAs. PWAs are not mobile applications but web applications that smartphone users can add as shortcuts to their home screen and offer a look and feel similar to native mobile apps. These frameworks are written in custom JS and they allow to create reusable building blocks.
Angular documentation: https://angular.io/docs

2. Testing tools should be used by web developers in ordr to check code before spread it in repo. With testing tools are defined checkpoints regarding target configurations or region configurations. One of testing tool is applitools>Docs>SDK user guide>The Eyes SDK check Fluent API which is available in Java/Javascript/C#
Documentation of applitools>Docs>SDK user guide>The Eyes SDK check Fluent API is at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-selenium?activeTab=readme

3. Code editor a web developer should have in order to produce web code more efficiently is Replit which is a browser IDE. This instant IDE should be used by web developers to code directly from browser with Replit. In this way is it possible to start coding instantly, right from browser. With GitHub integration and support for nearly every major programming language (for web developers: Node.js, HTML, CSS, JS, CoffeeScript, Roy, PHP Web Server).
